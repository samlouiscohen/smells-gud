Interfaces are promises to compiler
want the user to 
want negatuve resukt is a<b
positive if a>b
zero if z=b


Make the user promise me they will implement this method for me

You have to fill out all the methods exactly for any object that implemetns a interface

Know:


N
NlogN
N^2
2^n
logN


2.1 (in terms of big o)

2.6
x = n^2

2, 4, 16, 256, 65536
1, 2,  3,  4,    5

x = 2n+ 1+ n^2 

X = (n-1) + (n-1)^2 +2^n

Big O dont add constants, exponents
